# Simply Transparent

This is an old, old, project from high-school, it is a Windows desktop utility for Windows 98-2k (and maybe XP) that will force the background color on the desktop to be transparent.  It has a few other features as well like hiding the icons and changing the text label colors.

Its written in C++ and is currently built with Visual Studio.

Enjoy :)
